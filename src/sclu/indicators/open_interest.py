Open Interest Indicators for SCLU Trading Strategy.

This module contains custom indicators for analyzing Open Interest data
in options trading. The indicators include:
- Open Interest Indicator
- First Derivative of Open Interest (rate of change)
- Second Derivative of Open Interest (acceleration/deceleration)
